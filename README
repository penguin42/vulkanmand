Just my Vulkan playground

Feel free to use this code as you like; some is based on
the Vulkano examples.  Please credit me for the rest.

TODO:
  Use image rather than buffer for voxels
  Speed up raytracer (slower than OpenCL)
    Stop passing byte array for output image to render_image
  Fix gl_NumWorkGroups use in mandel to allow x/y local sizes
  stop using storage buffers?
