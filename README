Just my Vulkan playground
  (c) 2018 Dr. David Alan Gilbert dave@treblig.org

Feel free to use this code as you like; some is based on
the Vulkano examples.  Please credit me for the rest.

TODO:
  Choose the compute queue better (avoid graphics)
  Fix up the EmptyShaderInterfaceDef's that are just wrong
  Fix up resizing
    -> Mayneed to redo the rebuild swapchain code
  Wayland
  Move the X/Wayland code out into Vulkano
  Make the vertex shader plot a cube, do all the transforms
   and just give the fragment shader the point on the cube it can see
